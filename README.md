# Credit Risk Predictive Model
A dashboard was implemented in the HELOC dataset (CSV included) using a logistic regression model to classify credit risk.

Different models were tested: Decision Tree, k-nn, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression.
The selected model is Logistic Regression (0.725 Train Acc, 0.718 Validation Acc, 0.725 CV Acc) due to computational cost and simplicity to explain to a non technical third party.

The following repository contains the data, code (Jupyter Notebook and Interactive Dashboard) and report.
